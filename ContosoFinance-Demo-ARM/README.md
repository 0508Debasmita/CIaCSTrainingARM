# Introduction 
In this project we will create a Website using Azure App Service.

#  What is Azure App Service?
Azure App Service is a Platform as a Service (PaaS), in other words it is a fully managed platform used for hosting web applications, like this one below, Mobile Apps, Logic Apps, API Apps and Function Apps.

# Why Should you use Infrastructure as Code?
Infrastructure as code (IaC) enables you to automatically provision your environment with no manual intervention. For this demo we use JSON however the same resources can be deployed using different languages such as Bicep or Terraform.
